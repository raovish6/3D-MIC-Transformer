# 3D-MIC-Transformer
3D-MIC-Transformer: Transformer for Medical Image Classification

In this repository, we present the pytorch model architecture for 3D-MIC-Transformer, a general Transformer-based medical image classification framework. Our model is built off of the architecture first proposed in Wang et al. (https://github.com/Wenxuan-1119/TransBTS)
